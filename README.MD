# Atlas Custom Server 4x4
This can be used as a template for anyone looking to setup a 4x4 atlas server on Nitrado (https://server.nitrado.net/usa/rent-gameserver). Currently the map only has islands in two of the four grids. Each cell in the grid is it's own server. So essentially this map can be expanded to use a total of 4 servers.
